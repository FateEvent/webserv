To launch the server:
- modify, in `config/home.conf`, the IP address (by typing the command `ifconfig`, for example, that displays the current configuration for a network interface) and the root path;
- compile the program files, using the command `make`;
- execute the program with the command `./webserv config/home.conf`.
